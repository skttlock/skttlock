### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Joshua, welcome! 
Right now, I'm focused on learning Cystal!

### Projects
With a shift towards meticulous comprehension, my ethos on project work has dramatically changed. I want to relearn everything I know, thought I knew, and learn what I don't in software development. So, I've decided to 'shut down' project work of my own for now. To ease the project-hunger pain, I'll still be filing away ideas into my Obsidian vault, but this is to get the ideas out of my head, not work on them further (until I feel 'ready'). You won't be seeing those here anytime soon (not that I've updated my GitHub much in the past anyways!)

Thanks for sticking around :)
